# Implicit-Im2col-for-Backpropagation


## Analysis-of-sparsity
This project aims to obtain the configuration of the convolutional layers of some models to facilitate the use of GPU experiments. At the same time, we also analyzed how many zero data will be generated by the feature maps and kernel during inference and backpropagation in the conventional systolic array implementation, after im2col is executed, and due to these zero data Additional storage overhead incurred. Detailed instructions can be found in the `Analysis-of-sparsity` folder.
